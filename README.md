# fishoal
Shoal of fish modelisation as a system of particles with varying behaviours.

The files **<span>aquarium.py</span>**, **<span>fishes.py</span>** and **<span>behaviors.py</span>** implement the backend of the simulation in an object oriented programming way.

A report named **<span>rapport_mod_geo_Klein_Ragot.pdf</span>** in french can be found in the repository.

The jupyter notebook named **<span>simulations.ipynb</span>** can be used to visualize some examples of simulations of fishes.
